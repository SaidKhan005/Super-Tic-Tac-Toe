## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can install the Bottle framework using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

This will install the Bottle framework and its dependencies on your system. After installing Bottle, you're ready to run the project.

## Usage

To start the server and play the game, run the following command:

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the game.

The next page will be the game board where you can start to play, simply click the square that you want to make your move in.
