### Kanban Items:

Throughout our project discussions, all identified issues and areas for improvement were thoroughly addressed, whether in person or over text. Consequently, there was no need to formally add items to the Kanban board. None of the issues were alarming and so it would be falsifying to add issues that didn't exist. The best I can do is make suggestions for improvements.

### Overall Assessment:

During the project, our team encountered various areas for improvement and suggestions for individual growth. However, it's noteworthy that none of these issues posed a significant hindrance to the project's progress. Despite the identified areas for improvement, our team effectively managed to meet deadlines and stay on track with the project objectives.

Overall, our team demonstrated remarkable cohesion and resilience, ensuring the successful execution of the project.
