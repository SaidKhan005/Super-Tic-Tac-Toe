### Kanban Items:

Throughout our project discussions, most of the identified issues and areas for improvement were thoroughly addressed. Most of the issues we faced during the
meetings and code review were added to the issue tracker/kanban board. As for issues with team members, none of them were too significant to be added to the issue tracker/
kanban board. Nothing that couldn't be resolved with a simple text message.

During the project, our team encountered various areas for improvement and suggestions for individual growth. However, it's noteworthy 
that none of these issues posed a significant hindrance to the project's progress. Despite the identified areas for improvement, our team 
effectively managed to meet deadlines and stay on track with the project objectives.

Overall, our team demonstrated remarkable cohesion and resilience, ensuring the successful execution of the project.
