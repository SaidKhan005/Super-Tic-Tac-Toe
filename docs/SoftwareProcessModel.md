## Process Identification and Explanation:

Process: The software development process for the online Tic-Tac-Toe server game involves several stages, including requirements gathering from assignment instructions, architecture design, implementation, testing and final deployment.

Process Model: We follow an Agile development process, which emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, trial and error and **in-person** collaboration among team members.

## Changes in Process Since Beginning of Project:

**Code Reviews:** Bi-Weekly code reviews have been integrated into our process, enhancing code uniformity, consistency and promoting knowledge sharing among team members.

**GitHub's Kanban Board and Issue Tracker:** We've adopted GitHub's Kanban board and issue tracker to streamline project management, task tracking, and issue resolution. This has improved visibility, coordination, and efficiency within the team.

**Discord Group for Code Sharing:** A Discord group has been created to facilitate code sharing and updates on errors. This platform allows team members to communicate in real-time, share code snippets, discuss changes, and provide immediate feedback.

**Collective Coding Effort for Feature Implementation:** We've adopted a collective coding approach for implementing features that span multiple modules. Despite the features being associated with specific modules, team members collaborate collectively on implementing them, ensuring a cohesive and integrated approach to development. Each Member is then responsible for pushing their individual branches and taking care of their individual unit tests, Code docstrings and uml diagrams.

**Use of Backlog for Assignment 1 Feedback:** The backlog has been used to address feedback from Assignment 1. This backlog contains tasks aimed at resolving issues identified during the feedback process, ensuring that improvements are systematically implemented and tracked.

## Changes in Process Model Since Sprint 1:

**Code Review Formalization and Meeting Notes Standardization:**
Previously, our code review process primarily consisted of verbal discussions. However, since Sprint 1, we have formalized our code review process. Each team member now follows a predefined template for code reviews, ensuring consistency across the team and covering all essential aspects systematically. Additionally, we have standardized our meeting notes documentation to ensure that important discussions and decisions are captured consistently.

**Enhanced Flexibility in Pull Request Merging:**
Previously, any minor change required review by Kaleb, our PR reviewer. However, since gaining a better understanding of Git and our collaborative process, we have become more flexible with merging pull requests. Minor changes, such as meeting notes and code review updates, can now be merged directly without the need for formal PR review, enabling smoother workflow and quicker iterations.

## Additional Information:

Roles and Responsibilities: Each team member is responsible for a separate module in the game. However, when implementing features that span multiple modules, team members collaborate collectively on coding efforts, regardless of the module they are associated with. Feature descriptions specify the modules that will be utilized, ensuring clarity and coordination during implementation.

Artifacts and Deliverables: Deliverables include code changes, documentation updates, resolved issues tracked on GitHub, and shared code snippets via Discord. Feature descriptions provide guidance on the modules affected by each feature, facilitating effective collaboration.

Entry and Exit Criteria: Tasks must meet defined acceptance criteria before being moved to the "Done" column on the Kanban board. Collective coding efforts ensure that features are implemented seamlessly across modules, meeting acceptance criteria effectively.

Testing: Testing is conducted at each stage of development. Discord discussions aid in identifying and resolving testing issues promptly, ensuring comprehensive coverage across modules.

Change Management: Changes to requirements or code are managed through GitHub's pull request feature, with reviews and team approval required before merging. Discord discussions provide supplementary feedback and validation, especially for features that impact multiple modules.

Documentation Standards: Documentation is maintained within the project repository using Markdown files
