## Introducing Dynamic Challenges with Move Timer

As a Player, I want to elevate my experience in Ultimate Tic Tac Toe by incorporating dynamic challenges that add excitement and complexity to the gameplay, all while enforcing a move timer to maintain a sense of urgency and strategy.

- Upon starting a new game, I desire the option to engage in dynamic challenges that introduce unique objectives or constraints to each match, enhancing strategic decision-making within a limited time frame.
- Each challenge should offer different rewards upon completion, encouraging players to explore various gameplay styles and tactics while adhering to the move timer.
- Players can access a diverse range of challenges, from time-based trials to board-size alterations, catering to different preferences and skill levels, all within the confines of the move timer.

## Implementation

- Integrate a system within the game logic to generate and manage dynamic challenges seamlessly during gameplay while incorporating a move timer to enforce time constraints for each move.
- Establish a rewards system for successfully completing challenges, incentivizing players to embrace diverse gameplay experiences within the allotted time.
- Design and implement various challenge types, ensuring a balance between difficulty and enjoyment, while accounting for the time-sensitive nature of gameplay.
- Incorporate visual cues and UI elements to notify players of active challenges and track their progress throughout the game session, including the remaining time on the move timer.
- Test and iterate on challenge mechanics to ensure they contribute positively to the overall gaming experience while maintaining the integrity of the move timer functionality.
